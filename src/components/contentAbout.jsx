        Linear algebra is undeniably the base for many fields of sciences such
        as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Supply Chain
        Management, Digital Signal Processing, Pattern Recognition, to name a
        few. Thus it has become mandatory for researchers and faculties to
        revise and be updated with this subject.

        This FDP is mainly focused on brushing up the basics as well as bringing
        out the research being carried out around the globe about the
        applications in different domains. This FDP will introduce the basics of
        Linear Algebra at a post graduate level and also showcase applications
        currently being researched.
      </p>
      <p className="about-para2">
        Both research scholars and faculties working in the linear algebra and
        its allied areas are welcome to participate. Highly motivated graduate
        students will also be permitted to attend.
