                ON BRUSHING OUT THE BASICS AND BRINGING OUT THE
                RESEARCHERS AROUND THE GLOBE TO DISCUSS THE APPLICATIONS
                IN DIFFERENT DOMAINS. BOTH RESEARCH SCHOLARS AND
                FACULTIES WORKING IN THE FIELD OF LINEAR ALGEBRA
                AND ITS ALLIED AREAS ARE WELCOME TO PARTICIPATE
                HOWEVER, HIGHLY MOTIVATED GRADUATED AND UNDERGRADUATE
                STUDENTS WILL BE PERMITTED TO ATTEND.
